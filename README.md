# STAFF-PROMOTION-MODEL
# Developing Staff Promotion Algorithm - GitHub README Description  

This project focuses on building a **Staff Promotion Prediction Algorithm** using machine learning. The model analyzes employee data, including performance metrics, experience, and other key factors, to predict whether an employee is likely to be promoted.  

### **Key Features**  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover promotion trends  
- Model selection and performance evaluation  
- Deployment-ready classification model  

### **Use Case**  
This model helps HR departments make data-driven promotion decisions, reducing bias and improving workforce planning.  

Would you like me to include dataset details or implementation steps?
